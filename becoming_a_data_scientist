# From Natuaral Science PhD to Machine Learning Professional

## scikit-learn (sklearn) python module

Run through some of the tutorials at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/

Develop a familiarity with the vocabulary and the comparative advantages of various types of models. Learn about tuning hyperparameters, tuning classifier thresholds, model evaluation (precision, recall, AUC), supervised and un-supervised methods, pre-processing steps for various types of data (including natural language texts).

## R

I'm not an R user, but if you're inclined in that direction it might be useful to look at some R machine learning packages.

## Scala


## Kagel

Personally, I've never participated in a kagel competition, but I have absorbed some practical tips from perusing blog posts by successful competitors.
